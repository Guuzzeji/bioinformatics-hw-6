# Python Example Using BioPython

This is using Python 3.12.6 

## Setup

**Set up a virtual environment and install the required packages**

1. Create a Python virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the necessary Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Tip:** Ensure the `requirements.txt` file is in the projectâ€™s root directory. This file should contain all the dependencies needed for the project.

## Running the Script

To run the Python scripts, use one of the following commands:

```bash
python3.12 main.py
```

or 

```bash
python3.12 main.py SEQUENCE_1 SEQUENCE_2
```
